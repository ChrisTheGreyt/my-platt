First, we do not have a fixed checklist of particular attributes we seek in our students, and you will have the best insights into what is most important for us to know. Second, there is no set convention for communicating the information you choose to share. A successful essay might involve writing directly about expansive themes such as your goals or philosophy or background or identity, or very differently, might be a vignette that reveals something significant about you. Your personal statement gives us an opportunity to get a sense of your voice, perspective, and experiences, as well as your writing ability, and there is no particular formula to follow. Applicants have in the past elaborated on their significant life experiences; meaningful intellectual interests and extracurricular activities; factors inspiring them to obtain a legal education or to pursue particular career goals; significant obstacles met and overcome; special talents or skills; issues of identity, such as gender, sex, race, or ethnicity; particular political, philosophical, or religious beliefs; socioeconomic challenges; atypical backgrounds, educational paths, employment histories, or prior careers; or experiences and perspectives relating to discrimination, disadvantage, or disability. Any of these subjects, and many more, could be an appropriate basis for communicating authentic and genuine information about yourself that will aid us in reaching a thoughtful decision. In other words, think broadly about what you might wish to convey and how you might best convey it. \nWhile we do not impose a page or word limit for the personal statement, we value clear and concise writing; most personal statements are between two and four pages.

Similarly, some applciants will feel compelled to submit a response to  Essay Prompt #8 because it suggests that you need a strong interest in Tulane in order to receive strong admission consideration. Rest assured that our Admissions Committee doesn't care which essay(s) you choose to submit.

In answering this prompt, definite the word ?community? as you personally see fit.\nEssay Option 3\nDescribe a situation where you took a stand for a cause or principle you strongly believed was right, even when it was challenging or unpopular. How did your personal values and life history motivate you to advocate for this cause? Share the actions you took and the results you achieved through your advocacy.\nEssay Option 4\nReflect on an experience where you demonstrated empathy and understanding towards someone with different perspectives, beliefs, or backgrounds. How did your ability to empathize and see the world from their viewpoint contribute to resolving a conflict or fostering a positive relationship?  Provide specific instances of how you practiced empathy in your interactions.\nEssay Option 5\nShare an experience in which you successfully built meaningful connections with people who had vastly different views, values, or backgrounds from your own. How did you approach these relationships, and how did they shape your own beliefs or actions? Discuss how these connections have enriched your perspective.\nEssay Option 6\nDescribe a situation where you effectively managed your time to support the needs of others while juggling various other responsibilities such as education, extracurricular activities, or employment. How did your organizational skills and commitment to serve others enable you to make a meaningful impact on causes you care about or the lives of those you hold dear?

Our students pursue a rigorous course of study immersed in an environment of public service and community engagement.  By fostering a mature sense of integrity and an awareness of an ever-evolving legal profession, we empower students to succeed as citizens, professionals, and leaders. \nNumerical indicators (LSAT score, UGPA, etc.) are not dispositive of an applicant?s ability to succeed at the study and practice of law.  Other factors are important in assessing an applicant?s potential to distinguish themselves and engage in the educational process and the legal profession.   \nThe following questions aim to add context to your numerical indicators and aid us in matriculating students who will assist us in fulfilling our mission.  \nPrompts\nPlease answer the following questions.
